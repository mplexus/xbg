# xbg
Pick a background for your linux desktop

This is a perl script that will dig into your images and randomly pick one to set it as your wallpaper in linux distributions.

Put xbg anywhere in your path (eg /usr/local/bin) and make it executable (eg chmod +x ./xbg).

It creates a file in /tmp to store your current selection in order to select the next or previous one of an ordered call, or to not select the same one if called randomly.

./xbg --help for command options and details.
